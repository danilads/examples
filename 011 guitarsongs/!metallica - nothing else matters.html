<h3>METALLICA - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS</h3>
<h5>Intro:</h5>
<span>
	So close, no matter how far
	Couldn't be much more from the heart
	Forever trusting who we are
	And nothing else matters

	Never opened myself this way
	Life is ours, we live it our way
	All these words I don't just say
	And nothing else matters

	Trust I seek and I find in you
	Every day for us something new
	Open mind for a different view
	And nothing else matters

	Never cared for what they do
	Never cared for what they know
	But I know

	So close, no matter how far
	Couldn't be much more from the heart
	Forever trusting who we are
	And nothing else matters

	Never cared for what they do
	Never cared for what they know
	But I know

	I never opened myself this way
	Life is ours, we live it our way
	All these words I don't just say
	And nothing else matters

	Trust I seek and I find in you
	Every day for us, something new
	Open mind for a different view
	And nothing else matters

	Never cared for what they say
	Never cared for games they play
	Never cared for what they do
	Never cared for what they know
	And I know, yeah!
	
	So close, no matter how far
	Couldn't be much more from the heart
	Forever trusting who we are
	No, nothing else matters
