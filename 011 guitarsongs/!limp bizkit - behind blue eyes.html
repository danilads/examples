<h3>LIMP BIZKIT - BEHIND BLUE EYES</h3>
<h5>Intro:</h5>
<span>
		No one knows what it's like
		To be the bad man
		To be the sad man
		Behind blue eyes

		And no one knows what it's like
		To be hated
		To be faded
		to telling only lies

		But my dreams they aren't as empty
		As my conscience seems to be
		I have hours, only lonely
		My love is vengeance
		That's never free

		No one knows what its like
		To feel these feelings
		Like I do
		And I blame you
		
		No one bites back as hard
		On their anger
		None of my pain and woe
		Can show through

		But my dreams they aren't as empty
		As my conscience seems to be
		I have hours, only lonely
		My love is vengeance
		That's never free

		No one knows what its like
		To be mistreated,
		to be defeated
		Behind blue eyes

		An no one know how to say
		That they're sorry
		and don't worry
		I'm not telling lies

		But my dreams they aren't as empty
		As my conscience seems to be
		I have hours, only lonely
		My love is vengeance
		That's never free
		
		No one knows what its like
		To be the bad man
		To be the sad man
		Behind blue eyes
