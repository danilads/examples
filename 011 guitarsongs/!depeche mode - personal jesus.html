<h3>DEPECHE MODE - PERSONAL JESUS</h3>
<span>
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there 

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer 

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith 



Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there 

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver 

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
