<h3>TITO & TARANTULA - AFTER DARK</h3>

<span>
Watching her
Strolling in the night so white
Wondering why
It's only after dark

In her eyes
A distant fire light burns bright
Wondering why
It's only after dark

I find myself in her room
Feel the fever of my doom
Falling falling
Through the floor
I'm knocking on the devil's door yeah

In the dawn
I wake up to find her gone
And the note
Says "only after dark"

Burning burning in the flame
Now I know her secret name
You can tear her temple down
But she'll be back and rule again yeah

In my heart a deep and dark
And lonely part
Wants her and waits for
After dark
After dark
After dark
After dark
